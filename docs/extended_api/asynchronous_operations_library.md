# Asynchronous operations library

The asynchronous operations library provides components for asynchronous data movement.

## Shapes

| [aligned_size_t](./asynchronous_operations_library/aligned_size_t.md) | defines an extent of bytes with a statically defined alignment `(class template)` |

## Asynchronous operations

| [memcpy_async](./asynchronous_operations_library/memcpy_async.md) | asynchronously copies one buffer to another `(function template)` |
